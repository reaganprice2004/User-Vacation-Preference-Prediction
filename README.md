# 🏖️🏔️ User Vacation Preference Prediction
**Course:** ISE-221: Intelligent Systems 1

**Timeline:** October 2024-December 2024

**Team Members:** Carter Thumm, David McDonald, and Landon Houston

## 🗺️ Overview
This project explores the development of classification models to predict whether individuals prefer vacationing in the **mountains** or at the **beach**, based on features such as
- Age
- Proximity to mountains and beaches
- Vacation budget

We implemented both **logistic regression** and an **artificial neural network (ANN)** to compare their performance and identify key predictors of user preference
## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Build a classification model to predict vacation preferences
- Handle and correct for imbalanced classes in the dataset
- Evaluate model performance using classification metrics
- Compare the performance between the two models
- Understand model behavior and identify areas for improvement
## 🧹 Data Preprocessing
- **Dataset:** `MvS-Scaled.csv` 
- **Features Selected:**
    - `Proximity_to_Mountains`
    - `Proximity_to_Beaches`
    - `Vacation_Budget`
    - `Age`
  - **Target Variable:** `Preference` (0 = beach, 1 = mountains).
  ## 📐 Feature Scaling
  - Applied `StandardScaler` to normalize input features (mean = 0, std = 1).
  ## ⚖️ Handling Imbalanced Data
  - Resampled the minority class (Mountains preference) using upsampling to match the majority class (Beach).
  ## 🤖 Model #1: Logistic Regression
  ### Model Details
  - Trained using scaled features
  - Evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score, and a confusion matrix.
  ### Performance Summary
  |  Metric   | Class 0 (Beach)  | Class 1 (Mountain)  |
  |-----------|------------------|---------------------|
  | Precision | 0.80             | 0.50                |
  | Recall    | 0.89             | 0.33                |
  | F1-score  | 0.84             | 0.39                |
- **Observation:** The model performs significantly better on beach preferences due to initial class imbalance.
## 🤖 Model #2: Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
### Implementation
- Framework: TensorFlow Keras
- Layers:
    - Input: 3 neurons
    - Hidden Layer 1: 64 neurons (ReLU)
    - Hidden Layer 2: 32 neurons (ReLU)
    - Output: 1 neuron (Sigmoid for binary classification)
### Training Details
- Epochs: 50
- Batch Size: 32
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss Function: Binary cross-entropy
## Evaluation
- Trained and validated using resampled data.
- Plotted training/validation accuracy and loss.
- Evaluated using a classification report and a confusion matrix.
## 📊 Performance Comparison
|  Metric   | Logistic Regression  | ANN    |
|-----------|----------------------|--------|
| Training Loss | Converges steadily  | Decreases and stabilizes |
| Validation Loss | Moderate          | Initially drops, then fluctuates |
| Accurary        | High              | Very high |
| Precision       | Decent            | Superior  |
| F1 Score        | Balanced          | Balanced  |
| Confusion Matrix | Some false positives | Fewer errors overall |
## 🔑 Key Learnings and Reflections
- Logistic Regression is interpretable and fast, but struggles with complex patterns.
- ANN captures non-linear relationships more effectively.
- Resampling was essential to overcoming class imbalance.
- Regularization and loss visualization provided key insights into model behavior.
## 💡 Future Work/Ideas
- Hyperparameter tuning for both models.
- Add demographic features for better accuracy.
- Apply cross-validation.
- Try ensemble models.
- Deploy as a simple web app for user input/prediction.
## 🏃 Running the Code
1. Upload `MvS-Scaled.csv` to your environment.
2. Run the `Initial Code` for basic exploration and Logistic Regression.
3. Run the `ANN Code` to train and evaluate the neural network.
4. Use the `Final Code` for advanced training with visualization and regularization.
